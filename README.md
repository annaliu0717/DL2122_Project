**prep_data.csv** : data after preprocessing, can be directly applied for binary and multi-classification**
**processed.cleveland.data.csv** : original data 

**uci_heart_disease_detection_binary** : code for data preprocessing and binary classification task, main code for our report.
  - Binary classification, MODEL:SVM, ACCURACY: 90% AUC:95%
**uci_heart_disease_multi-class**: our code applied for multi-classification. Testing result is only with accuracy 30%, Training is 100% correct.
  - The classifier can predict a sample correct only when it has seen sample during training :(
